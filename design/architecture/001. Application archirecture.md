# 前提
👉「Disk(TB)」→「RAM(GB)」→「CPU)」→「Cache(MB)」<br>
✅The RAM and the disc can't directly talk with each other.<br>
✅The CPU read and write for the RAM and the disk.<br>
✅When code executed,<br>
　・CPU reads code on RAM<br>
　・Declare variables -> store them on RAM ...

The slower read/write, the bigger storage (:<br>
The faster read/write, the smaller storage (: 

||Write and Read|Store|
|----|----|----|
|RAM|Faster|Less(GB)|
|Disk|Slower|More(TB)|

## Want to read faster than RAM.... what do we do next?
✅The cache is a component which is NOT separate from out CPU.

👉Individual computers have limitations.<br>
✅So we combine multiple computers -> **Distributed Systems**.<br>

# Consider Application architecture with scaling multiple servers
・CICD environment<br>
・Server(Scaling)<br>
・Storage(DB)<br>
・Logging Storage<br>
・Metrics(Opensearch/Kibana)

## Scaling
Make the single server better -> ✅**Vertical Scaling**(Upgrade CPU / RAM / Disks)

　↓ but individual computers have its own limitation.

Make copies of a server -> ✅**Horizontal Scaling**<br>
👉LoadBalancer basically forwards the request to the server that has the minimal amount of traffic so that each of servers has a balanced amount of traffic.
