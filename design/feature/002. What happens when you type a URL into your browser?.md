以下の順序。
1. DNS lookup → cacheにあれば取得。なければ問い合わせる。
2. TCP handshake → establish a TCP connection.
3. (If HTTPS) TLS/SSL handshake → establish an encrypted connection.
4. Request a HTTP request.
5. Renders a HTML.

# 3. TCP handshake
・establish a TCP connection.<br>
・It takes several network round trips.<br>
・To keep the loading process fast, modern browsers use something called a **keep-alive connection** to try to reuse an established TCP connection to the server.

If the protocol is HTTPS, it requires a complicated process called SSL/TLS handshake
to establish the ecrypted connection between the browser and the server.

Finally, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server OVER the established TCP connection.
